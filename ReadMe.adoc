== Project Overview

This project automates the testing of the XYZBank web application using Playwright for end-to-end browser automation and Cucumber for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style acceptance tests. It includes:

* Playwright test suites for UI functionality
* Cucumber feature files for BDD scenarios
* Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for maintainability
* Parallel execution and retry mechanisms for stability

== Test Execution Scripts

The following NPM scripts are available for executing various test suites and generating reports:

[options="header",cols="1,3,6"]
|===
| Script Name            | Command                                            | Description

| fullRegression         | `npm run fullRegression`                           | Runs the entire Playwright test suite (all tests and browsers)

| customerTestsChromium  | `npm run customerTestsChromium`                    | Runs only tests tagged with `@customerOnly` on Chromium browser

| managerTests           | `npm run managerTests`                             | Runs only tests tagged with `@managerOnly`

| negativeTests          | `npm run negativeTests`                            | Runs tests tagged with `@negative` to validate negative scenarios

| smokeTestsChromium     | `npm run smokeTestsChromium`                       | Runs smoke tests tagged with `@smoke` on Chromium

| customerTestsFirefox   | `npm run customerTestsFirefox`                     | Runs `@customerOnly` tests on Firefox browser

| cucumberRegression     | `npm run cucumberRegression`                       | Executes Cucumber BDD tests in parallel with retries and generates an HTML report at `cucumber-report.html`

|===

== Viewing Test Reports

* Playwright reports (HTML, screenshots, traces) will be generated in the `playwright-report/` directory by default.
* Cucumber HTML report is generated as `cucumber-report.html` in the project root after running `cucumberRegression`.
* Open reports in your browser:

[source,bash]
----
open cucumber-report.html    # macOS
start cucumber-report.html   # Windows
xdg-open cucumber-report.html # Linux
----

== Screenshots and Traces

* Screenshots of failed tests are saved under `screenshots/` folder.
* Playwright trace files (`.zip`) for failed scenarios are saved under `traces/` folder.
* To view traces, run:

[source,bash]
----
npx playwright show-trace traces/<trace-file>.zip
----

== Folder and File Naming Conventions

* Step definitions are located in `features/step_definitions/`
* Hooks (setup and teardown) are in `features/hooks/`
* Feature files (`*.feature`) are stored directly under `features/`
* Test data JSON files are under `testdataUtils/`

== Additional Notes

* The project uses `ts-node` to run TypeScript files directly with Cucumber.
* JSON test data imports are configured using `resolveJsonModule` in `tsconfig.json`.
* Playwright context and browser are managed per scenario in hooks to ensure isolation.
* Test retries and parallel execution improve stability and speed.
